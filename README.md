# Epl::Stats::Project

This program was built as a practice application for the FlatIron course. Currently this scrapes information from the website https://sports.ndtv.com/english-premier-league/stats/top-goal-scorers-player-statsdetail and displays the top scorers from this past English Premier League (EPL) season. As a future update I plan to extend this project by pulling information directly from the EPLs API which will allow for a more stable and robust application to be built.

## Installation

To get this program up and running clone this repo down to your local environment by running the command `git clone git@github.com:educhin/epl-stats-project.git` in your console.

Once the repo has been clone to your local device cd into the project folder and run the command `ruby bin/eplstats`

## Usage

This application is used to view top scorers in the EPL using the following commands
  To view a list of teams type: Show all teams
  To view a list of all top scorers type: Show all players
  To view a list of top scorers from a team type the team's name full name
  To exit type: Exit
  To see these instructions again type: Help

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
